# Git commands that I know
- `git init`
- `git status`
- `git diff`  
- `git add <filename>`
- `git commit -m "Message here"`
- `git clone [add name of repository here copied from github]`
- `git push` push it up to github!
**that's enough for now**
1 more change to see if I can push, now that I've removed my remote repository
